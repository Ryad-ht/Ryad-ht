👀 I’m interested in Data Analysis and currently focusing on Deep Learning, particularly Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

🌱 I’m actively learning and expanding my knowledge in these areas.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI projects and open-source initiatives related to data analysis and machine learning.

💻 I have experience coding in both Java and Python.
